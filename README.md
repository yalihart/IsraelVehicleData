This project is an interactive web tool designed to make vehicle data in Israel accessible. The website pulls live data from the government's open data platform, presenting it in a clear and user-friendly way. The goal of this project is to provide a quick and comprehensive look into the Israeli vehicle landscape, whether you're interested in the big numbers or looking for details on a specific car.

## What Does the Website Offer?
The site is divided into three main sections:

1. **Vehicle Search by License Plate:** In this section, you can enter the license plate number of any vehicle in Israel to get detailed information about it, including the manufacturer, model, year of production, fuel type, and more. The system scans several government databases to present the most complete information possible.

2. **General Statistics:** This part provides aggregated data on various vehicle types, including the total number of private cars, motorcycles, aircraft, and disabled vehicles. The data is updated automatically to reflect the latest statistics.

3. **Top Areas with Electric Vehicles:** This table shows the top ten sub-districts (Nafot) in Israel with the highest number of electric vehicles. It's a great way to see where EV adoption is gaining momentum in the country.

### Technologies
